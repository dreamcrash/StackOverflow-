This repository contains code from some of my answers on Stack Overflow.

If the code showcased here has helped you in any way, **consider upvoting the corresponding question/answer on Stack Overflow :)**.

**Bear in mind that all the code in this repository is proof of concept**â€”not production-ready or bulletproof. Moreover, not all of the code presented here was written entirely by me; some of it was copied from the corresponding question, and I have (improved or) modified parts of it to make it work.

I have limited free time, which is why the code here does not receive my full attention and dedication. There is certainly room for improvement :), so feel free to contribute!
