This repo contains the code of some of my answers on StackOverflow.

If the code from the answers showcased here has helped you in any way, consider upvoting the correspondent answer on SO :).

Bear in mind that all the codes (in this redo) are proofs-of-concept; not bulletproof ready to use in production-type of code. Moreover, not all the code (presented on this repo) was done by me, some of the code was copied and paste from the corresponded question, and I just have (improved or) changed part of it to make it work.
