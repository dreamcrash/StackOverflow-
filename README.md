This repo contains the code of some of my answers on StackOverflow.

If the code from the answers showcased here has helped you in any way, **consider upvoting the correspondent question/answer on SO :)**.

**Bear in mind that all the codes (in this redo) are proofs-of-concept;** not bulletproof ready to use in production-type of code. Moreover, not all the code (presented on this repo) was done by me, some of the code was copied from the corresponded question, and I have (improved or) changed part of it to make it work.

I have little free time, and that is why the code shown here does not get my full attention and dedication. There is certainly a lot of room for improvement :), feel free to contribute.
