Repo to upload the code used to answer questions on stackoverflow.

If some you the answers provided here help you, consider upvoting the correspondent answer on SO :).

Bear in mind that all the code in this redo are basically prove of concepts; not bulletproof ready to use in production type of code. Moreover, not all the code (presented on this repo) was done by me, some of the code was copy and paste from the corresponded question, and I just have changed part of it to make it work.
